# IVT Token Governance

## Introduction

This document outlines the governance structure and processes for the IVT Token project. Our aim is to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and a clear decision-making process for the community. The governance model described here is designed to uphold the principles of decentralization, fairness, and community involvement.

## Principles

The IVT Token community adheres to the following principles:

- **Transparency**: All decisions, processes, and changes are documented and accessible to the community.
- **Inclusivity**: We value diverse perspectives and encourage participation from all members.
- **Decentralization**: Decisions are made collectively, avoiding undue influence from any single party.
- **Continuous Improvement**: We're committed to evolving and refining our processes based on community feedback.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and expect all members of the community to uphold it. This ensures a respectful and collaborative environment.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Core Maintainers**: Responsible for the overall direction of the project, reviewing and merging pull requests, and ensuring the project's health. They have commit access to the repository.
  
- **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes code, documentation, or other assets to the project. They may not have commit access but are integral to the project's success.
  
- **Community Managers**: Handle community queries, manage communication channels, and ensure a healthy and respectful community environment.
  
- **Advisory Board**: A group of experts or stakeholders who provide strategic guidance and feedback on the project's direction.

## Decision Making

Decisions are made based on consensus among core maintainers. Significant changes or contentious issues may be put to a community vote.

- **Regular Decisions**: Made by core maintainers, often through discussion on GitHub issues or pull requests.
  
- **Significant Decisions**: For major changes, a proposal (in the form of a GitHub issue or document) must be submitted and open for community discussion for a minimum period (e.g., one week). After the discussion period, core maintainers will make a decision based on community feedback and project needs.

## Proposing Changes

To propose changes to the IVT Token:

1. **Issues**: Create [an issue](https://github.com/investtools/ivttoken/issues) detailing the change, its rationale, and potential impact.
  
2. **Pull Requests**: For code or documentation changes, submit a pull request. Ensure you've reviewed existing [Pull Requests](https://github.com/investtools/ivttoken/pulls) to avoid duplication.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of conflicts or disagreements:

1. Parties involved will attempt to discuss and resolve the issue amicably.
  
2. If unresolved, the issue will be escalated to core maintainers for mediation.
  
3. As a last resort, the issue may be put to a community vote.

## Versioning and Releases

All notable changes will be documented in the `CHANGELOG.md`. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Amendments to Governance

Proposed changes to this governance document should be submitted as a pull request and are subject to approval by core maintainers after a community discussion period.
