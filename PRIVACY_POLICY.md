# Privacy Policy for Smart Contracts

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to the smart contracts developed and deployed by Investtools. Our smart contracts are designed for use in connecting underconnected schools to the internet through a blockchain model, rewarding ISPs and sponsors with connectivity tokens, and this policy outlines our practices regarding data and privacy in relation to the blockchain technology we employ.

## Data and Blockchain

### Smart Contract Interaction

- **Public Blockchain Data:** Our smart contracts operate on a public blockchain. Interactions with our smart contracts are inherently public and can include transaction data, wallet addresses, and other data typical of blockchain transactions.
- **Anonymity:** While blockchain data is public, it is not directly linked to personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, or physical addresses. Users interact with the blockchain via their digital wallet addresses.

### No Personal Data Collection

- **No Collection of Personal Information:** Our smart contracts do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users. Users interact with the smart contracts using their blockchain wallet addresses.

## Security and Transparency

- **Smart Contract Security:** We prioritize the security of our smart contracts and employ best practices in smart contract development and auditing.
- **Open Source:** Our smart contracts are open source, allowing anyone to review the code to understand how data is processed and ensuring transparency in our operations.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
